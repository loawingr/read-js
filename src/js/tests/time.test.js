        <p>To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom
        heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she
        eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that
        he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions,
        and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise
        but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
        reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen,
        but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position.
        He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a
        sneer. They were admirable things for the observerâ€”excellent
        for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions. But for
        the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate
        and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting
        factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental
        results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his
        own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a
        strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but
        one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of
        dubious and questionable memory.</p>
        <p>I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us
        away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the
        home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
        finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient
        to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every
        form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our
        lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating
        from week to week between cocaine and ambition,
        the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own
        keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the
        study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary
        powers of observation in following out those clues,
        and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as 
        hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some
        vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the
        case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular
        tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of
        the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully
        for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs
        of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the
        readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and
        companion.</p></div>`;
